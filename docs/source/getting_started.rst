Welcome to cuVS, the premier library for GPU-accelerated vector search and clustering! cuVS provides several core building blocks for constructing new algorithms, as well as end-to-end vector search and clustering algorithms for use either standalone or through a growing list of integrations.

If you are unfamiliar with the basics of vector search or how vector search differs from vector databases, then this guide should provide some good insight.
